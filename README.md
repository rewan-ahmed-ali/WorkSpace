# WorkSpace
We have created an application to facilitate communication between friends under the name Workspace. It is an application where each user creates his own personal page with a user name and a personal password. When created, the user is able to get to know the rest of the users in the application and share his ideas with them through the publications that he displays and exchanges. They share opinions through comments, learn about other cultures by participating in different groups, and build personal relationships with others through available conversations, establishing friendships, and communicating with different people. It is possible to create more than one personal page at the same time to provide the opportunity to create a private business on the application and exchange. Ideas and products will provide a lot of job opportunities by facilitating communication.
